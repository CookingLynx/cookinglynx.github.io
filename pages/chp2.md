# Chapter II – Training Arc

About a month had passed since GrazingDeer had joined **Stadium**, the epicenter of the LLB community. By now, he had roughly 75 hours in the game, and had attained a shiny blue belt. 

What are belts, you may ask? They are this universe's power ranking system.

| Belt Color | Requirements |
| White | None |
| Green | Reach 6th+ Division |
| Blue | Reach 4th+ Division |
| Purple | Reach 2nd+ Division |
| Red | Pass the Rooftop Exam |
| Pink | Become an Elite Warrior |
| Gold | Become a Grandmaster |
| Cyan | Become a Legend |

In truth, GD hadn't really tried to attain any specific belt until now. He merely played, and ended up reaching the requirements for blue belt. 

"*That's a bit tacky, don't you think?*" said Gromzuberg (AKA Grom), as he stared at the requirements table I wrote 2 paragraphs above. "*Why not just have fun?*"

Grom was a veteran player, but held little interest for LLB's more competitive aspects. Still, he was known as a powerful player, and an even more powerful techno-wizard.

"You're probably right..." said GD, hesitating. In truth, he couldn't help but want to prove himself in some way. There were few things he had been good at in the past, and he felt he needed to try.

Suddenly, bentrano03, the Jackpot God, enters the room. The air becomes still.

I can't stand to look at you. You disgust me. Your lineage is weak, your swing baits are fake, your setups are slow, and you <b><i>keep bunting in my face</i></b>. Despicable.'" %}

Scared, GD ran away, tears streaming down his youthful eyes.

Finally, he stops. As he wipes the tears from his cheeks, GD vows to one day become strong enough to stand his ground. The first step?

**Pass the Rooftop Exam.**
