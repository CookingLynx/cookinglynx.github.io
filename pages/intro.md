# Introduction

Before diving into it I will ask you to keep an open mind and really try to accept the things in this guide as useful. Not because they are for sure true, but because…

**You aren’t as good as you think you are.**

This isn’t a slight. 

No matter your skill level, you aren’t as good as you think you are. Neither am I. And I know for a fact if someone else wrote this I would come into it skeptical and think these things are either obvious, wrong, or maybe I just knew a better way to do it. 

If you start reading this very skeptically, chances are it won’t be as useful as it otherwise could. So, for the sake of maximizing what you can take away from this, I ask that you put down your sherlock hat until the end. Once you’re done, question it, criticize it, insult it **(please don’t)**, whatever you’d like. But give it the fairest shot you can. 

On the other hand, if you take everything said here as unquestionable and don’t try to piece them into your own experience, you’ll most definitely fall short. So, if you were coming into it ready to discard your experience and hope to adopt this one, rather than mix them both, please don’t.

My goal is to somehow condense everything I know into this guide, albeit in a digestible manner. I figure the best way to do so might be to take a narrative approach. Hopefully it makes things a bit more entertaining. 
I’m quite fond of theoretical views on the game, but hopefully I don’t exaggerate on that front. Still, forgive me if you end up reading something and feel the urge to explode in frustration and boredom.
