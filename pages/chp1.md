# Chapter I – Humble Beginnings 

Once upon a time, there was a player called “GrazingDeer” – GD for short. GD had picked up LLB on a whim, enticed by its funky soundtrack and wacky visuals.

The first thing he did was play through the story mode. The first few missions were a breeze – perhaps there was some hidden talent in GD? This notion quickly fell apart when he got stuck about halfway through. Still, GD kept playing, and ultimately beat the story mode.

Now richer in sparks, GD unlocked many things from the in-game shop. Still, he was short on funds and decided to follow the world-renowned guide [Economics 101](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1553972327) to quickly gather the remaining sparks necessary to unlock everything. 

Just kidding. He jumped into quick match, since he didn’t quite feel ready for ranked mode yet. However, he immediately gave up since the only person in quick match was a dice player who wouldn’t let them touch the ball at all. Ranked mode it is.

Ranked was worse. GD was a total beginner yet kept being matched against Division 1 players. Was there no hope for GD? Would he ever get to play the game without being stomped into the ground by anyone else they could find?
A notification pops up. A friend request from a player called birkkkk. GD reluctantly accepted, half expecting the player to berate him for his lousy performance.

GrazingDeer’s journey was just about to begin.

## Unexplained Mechanics

At this point in your LLB career, there are absolutely going to be mechanics you weren't even aware of, since they aren't explaiend anywhere in-game. Here are some of the more commonly skipped over mechanics in the game.

## Useful Beginner Resources

Rather than reinvent the wheel, I'm going to link a few great resources for new players, made by some legendary members of the community. Make sure to watch these, as they showcase some very important concepts and go into further detail on a few of the unexplained mechanics listed above.

<br>

### [Characters Move List](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1601989295)

Finding out how characters, inputs and specials work, can be a burden. This guide, created by [Daioutzu](https://steamcommunity.com/id/Daioutzu), will help you understand the fundamental tool set of each character, including their specials.

### [New Player Tips](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N0XvggmnJl4)

There are quite a few hidden aspects and recommended settings for LLB that can be hard to uncover. This video, created by [Desselie](https://www.youtube.com/@Desselie), sheds light on some of the things the tutorial doesn't teach you.

<iframe height="360px" width="100%" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/N0XvggmnJl4?si=naPN7zX-rAC0ZCXH" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe>

### [How To Catch The Ball](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LmekMCWYKVs)

There are many possible ways to catch the ball, yet new players will usually catch it with a smash (the worst option). This video, created by [Kirbbbb](https://www.youtube.com/@Kirbbbbbb), shows various different ways to catch the ball instead. While some of them are too advanced, it's still useful to know them.

### [LLB Dictionary](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N0XvggmnJl4)

Though a bit more advanced, it can still be useful to start getting acquainted with LLB jargon. This video, created by [Just_Gas](https://www.youtube.com/@justgas1903), will explain some of the more commonly used terms by the community.

<iframe height="360px" width="100%" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/TUnWz_Nz-9k?si=zKqLi5E5arItrpIs" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe>

## Want some tips?

There is no experience more humbling than joining a server for the first time, asking for games, and being absolutely battered for 45 minutes by a total stranger with 100x your hours. It’s a mix of awe and total frustration. If you’re lucky, you might get a few stocks here and there, and you will feel quite proud of that. 

The other player will then try harder and prevent you from doing anything at all. A truly miserable experience.

Maybe you'll be happy, though. You can't help but wish to become good enough to be on the other side of this exchange (and get sweet revenge on this player). 

**3 more**, the other player will say, and less than 5 minutes after you'll be done. You'll say something along the lines of “you’re crazy” and “thanks for playing with me”, but just as you're about to leave, they say: **want some tips**?

When this happens, most players tend to type, “yeah sure” and listen to what the better player has to say, occasionally explaining why they were doing what they were, or otherwise excusing their bad plays. 

Don’t be like those players. 

{% include sound_text.html sound_path="'/assets/audio/dn_bg.mp3'" initial_text="What should I do then?" final_text="Wring them dry.<br><br>When the fool decides to offer you tips of their own free will, you have them trapped.<br><br>You will ask everything you do not know, pester them for every minute detail, and wring them dry of their secrets.<br><br>Until the moment they pretend they have something else to go and do, do not let them leave, and if you\'re charming, you can even deceive them into promising to review one of your recordings in the future.<br><br>Acquire all of their secrets, absorb their knowledge, and bask in the stolen experience you have taken from them." %}

Now, depending on what kind of tips you get, you might end up even more confused than before. This is normal. Not good, but normal.

Don't be afraid to ask for more specifics or examples. You might not even be aware of the things they are mentioning, and without any concrete examples, its unlikely to become clearer. 


{% include tiger_quote.html title_value="<b>Why does my favorite top player suck at giving tips?</b>" text_value="<br>LLB is quite an abstract game, so explaining important things can be quite difficult. On the other hand, giving very concrete tips yields diminishing returns, as there are an infinite number of different possible interactions. If I tell you how to deal with one, congratulations - You have 10000 more to figure out.
<br><br>
As such, we are required to try and generalize situations into patterns. The broader the pattern, the more useful it is. However, it also requires more knowledge to understand. As you become immersed in the world of LLB, you will start to pick on these patterns, and jargon such as 'aggro', 'interception', 'ball control'... will begin taking on a life of their own." %}

<br><br>

## Welcome to Hell

LLB is, for all intents and purposes, a discord fighter. For those not acquainted with the term, it essentially means that you will mostly be able to find games and other players by joining discord servers (usually [Stadium](https://discord.gg/Cgf7jktJ)).

Sure, you might be able to find some players on ranked once in a while, but only during peak hours, not for very long, and not with very much quality.

{% include tiger_quote.html title_value="<b>But CT, what if I want to play ranked???</b>" text_value="<br>Well, little buddy, you can. Presuming you can find games there, that is. Usually, the best hours to do so are during the late afternoon in north america. However, be careful. While ranked is a decent way to fight different people, it can also lead to a terrible disease: <b>ranked playstyle</b>.
<br><br>
Those afflicted by this playstyle will often learn simple tactics that work for very short sets, but aren't actually very good. Also you will rage because losing and then the other person leaving is the worst feeling ever conceived in the known universe.
<br><br>
I'm not saying not to play ranked, go ahead. Just know that you will generally learn a lot more from fighting the same person (especially better players) for long periods of time, as it allows you to adapt and understand what you are consistently failing at." %}
<br>
The relatively low playerbase, compared to some other games, means that those who are still around are most likely going to be better than you.

Much better. 10 to 100 times better. So, don't get demotivated if you lose for a while. Unfortunately, it's normal.

Now, if you're lucky and get to find some new adventurers starting out their journey at the same time as you: <span class="bl-red"><b>for the love of god, hang unto them</b></span>.

![Battle of the Noobs](../assets/img/story/noob_battle.png)

It is much easier to stay motivated if you find someone of similar skill to spar with. But still, be prepared to lose horribly for the next 100 hours. Most of us went through that, you can do it too.

If it helps you, keep a list of despicable players you want to get revenge on in the future. A hit list is pretty common. I had one myself! :)

They are all dead now. 

<br><br>

## The Sins of Youth

Many a time I have seen newer players fall into the same bad habits. It's quite interesting really. 

The way new players approach this game is such a universal experience that everyone knows playing Candyman with the Liquorice skin is an telltale sign you've just started out. Despite that, people end up branching out into completely different and often innovative playstyles. It's one of the reasons this game is so beautiful.

{% include tiger_quote.html title_value="<b>AL, How come we all make the same mistakes?</b>" text_value="<br>Because you are an idiot.<br><br>Just kidding! We naturally tend to apply what we see is most effective against the opponent, that much is obvious. In the case of LLB, it's quite hard to do pretty much anything at all when starting out. Because of this, newer players will tend to default to the simplest things that have any percentage of success. Getting parried constantly? I'll grab it. Can't take the ball away? I'll be more aggressive.
<br><br>
The reality is that these patterns <i>are</i> in fact your best bet when it comes to winning. However, that's only because you're not proficient at the better options yet, and relying heavily on the simpler options will hurt you in the long run." %}
<br>
As such, I've ended up coining something I like to call the **3 deadly sins of new players**. I'll branch out on this idea below, adding a few other pitfalls you might end up in.

<br><br>
