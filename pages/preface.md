# Preface

If you’re reading this, chances are you’ve played enough Lethal League or Lethal League Blaze to understand they are unlike pretty much any other games around. Sure, there are similarities to some traditional fighting games, and you can absolutely make parallels between these games and a few other areas, but they’re still quite unique.

I’ve had the unfortunate blessing of putting thousands of hours into these games. I wasn’t an LL1 OG, so I can’t exactly say I’ve seen these games through all their eras, but still, I’d like to believe I have a relatively informed set of opinions when it comes to Lethal League.

Being good at this game comes in many forms, depending on your goals. For some, this might mean winning tournaments; for others, having unparalleled technical skills. In my biased opinion though, I believe the epitome of LL has two facets: to understand, and to enjoy. This is quite broad, I know, but to truly understand these games is hard. To do so with passion and enjoyment? That’s very rare.

I do not mean to say it is inevitable that you will end up becoming disheartened or jaded (you will) but piecing together a coherent and verifiable understanding of the game is a taxing thing. It is quite an abstract game in many ways, and navigating the fuzzy lessons the game will teach is akin to cleaning your room with the lights off.

 This is where I come in. At the risk of sounding arrogant (which I am, granted), I know quite a bit about this game. I’m good at it, and I understand it quite well. This wasn’t always the case, of course. I was bad once, and there are still many things I struggle with. However, I have learned many of the lessons, and seen many more do the same. I was not good at it, in the beginning. I was slow, and my progress was negligible compared to some of my peers.

However, my pride really wouldn’t allow me to stay behind forever. I leaned on those before me and was taught by many great players from the past. There are trials you must figure out by yourself, but if your pride is like mine, where you want to be very good at any cost, rather than very good by figuring it out yourself, I invite you to keep reading.

If you’ll let me, I will teach you what I know. And you will grab that knowledge and use it to soar higher than I ever could.
Thank you for taking the time to read this. I hope you enjoy.
